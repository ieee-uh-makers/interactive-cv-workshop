# IEEE Makers Interactive CV Workshop

Welcome to the Interactive Computer Vision Workshop! The point of these workshops are to be able to get your hands on some advanced computer vision algorithms with little prior knowledge of programming. We will cover many different techniques, going through each individual part of the algorithm in an interactive fashion.

## Planned Workshops
- Motion Detection
- Obstacle Avoidance (Classification)
- Object Detection (Regression)
- Preprocessing Techniques
- End-to-End training of a neural network for obstacle avoidance

## General Info

- While no prior programming experience is required for most of these workshops, we do recommend having some basic familiarity with programming languages such as MATLAB or C.
- We will be using the Anaconda distribution of python for each workshop, which can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution. Make sure you choose the Python 3.7 version of Anaconda.
- We will be running the workshops in Jupyter notebooks, you will need to change directory to workshop folder and run the command `jupyter notebook`. Then open up the specific notebook we will be covering that day in the notebooks folder. If you need help with this feel free to speak up!
